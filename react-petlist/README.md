## Tara's Finished Assignment

Hi dogvacay! Here is the repo for my frontend react interview assignment. I 
noticed that you had two typoes in the search.json so I fixed them - but it looks
like you're aware of the mistakes since someone submitted a pull request a few 
days ago on your repo.  

I also wasn't completely sure what you wanted for the Url field 
(without spaces and only with alphanumberic characters). I took a guess that you
wanted the endpoint reported when the user searches it, so that's what I did.

I also installed style-loader so I could put the CSS in a different module. 

Let me know if you have any questions! Here's a picture of the finished product:

# PetList Test
> These are a few modules of the 'Search Page' on our site.  
To view how the search page acts go to https://dogvacay.com/browse
We will be pseudo implementing some of the modules.

Write your JavaScript code in React Framework.  
You can write it in ES5 or ES6.
The 'Test' files are to make sure the project works.
You should spend only a few hours on this. i.e. no more then 4 hours.

## Goals

We are trying to get a sense of your day to day skills, and ability to write production ready code.
Treat this as a small project in which you would do for an actual job.

We are going to be examining how you approach the problem and solve it.
How you go about organizing your code.
When creating your code, realize that this code will have to be maintained by other members of your team.

The endpoints below will return the same data. We just want you to interact with the endpoint.
i.e. the data you get back from search.json will be the same as search.json?service=boarding or search.json?service=sitting

## Endpoints you will need:
```
  http://localhost:3000
  http://localhost:3000/static/search.json
  http://localhost:3000/static/search.json?service=boarding
  http://localhost:3000/static/search.json?service=sitting
```
## User Stories

__GIVEN__: A user comes to a search page  
__WHEN__: The user views the page  
__THEN__: They will see the results from the search.json above with the following fields:   

* Title
* Url
* First Name with Last Initial
* Pet Name
* Description


These are the rules for each field:
* Url
 * dashes for spaces
 * Only alpha numeric characters, underscore and dashes
 * no double dashses
 * i.e:
    * one two three => one-two-three
    * one two  three => one-two-three
    * one--two-three => one-two-three
* First Name with Last Initial
  * Capitalize the first character of the first name and last name
  * i.e.
    * seth broomer => Seth B.
* Description
  * At 48 characters and above we want to show ellipses
  * If the 48th character is in the middle of a word then we want to not show that word.
  * ie:
    * word1 description1 word2 description2 word3 description3 word4 description4 => word1 description1 word2 description2 word3...    

Use http://localhost:3000/static/search.json API  

__GIVEN__: A user comes to a search page  
__WHEN__: The user clicks on the boarding filter  
__THEN__: Then they will see the results from the search.json  with the service=boarding specified.  
Use http://localhost:3000/static/search.json?service=boarding API  

__GIVEN__: A user comes to a search page  
__WHEN__: The user clicks on the sitting filter  
__THEN__: Then they will see the results from the search.json  with the service=sitting specified.  
Use http://localhost:3000/static/search.json?service=sitting API

## Installing

You will need [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine. Once installed in your terminal, `cd` to the project directory and run `npm install`.

Once your dependencies are installed, you can run the command `npm run dev`. And you are ready to start coding.

## Help
Do whatever you feel you need to get this done or finished.
(Feel free to google if you need to!) But if you have any questions about the test itself or what
you need to do feel free to email Seth Broomer <seth@dogvacay.com>.

## Submission
Feel free to create a github repository and send us the link (encouraged!) or if you're more comfortable,
feel free to just send us a zip file with your code their.
